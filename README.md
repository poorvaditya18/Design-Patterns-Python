## Design Patterns 

- Mostly Design Patterns are language agnostic. These are created by `Gang of Four`. 
- link : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns  
- In this I will be covering examples of different design patterns using python. 
- This README will have a theoretical description of these design patterns. 
- According to "Gang of Four" there are 23 design patterns as I am preparing for interview and placement , I will be covering most common and famous design patterns with real world examples. 
- Let's start: 

### Recap : Object-Oriented Programming 
    - Dunder methods : __init__ (constructor), __del__ (destructor), Operator overloading (__add__) , __str__ , __repr__ 
    - 
    - Class variables :  are accessed using both Class name and instance of the class .
    - If you want regular method to convert as class method use `@classmethod` decorator.
